# React Snapshot Server

ðŸ“¸ A zero-configuration server that serves server-rendered snapshots of Create React App

## Starting the server

You can start the server by running `node node_modules/react-snapshot-server/bin/cli.js`.
To make this easier you can open up your `package.json` and add the following script
```
  "scripts": {
    ...
    "serve": "react-snapshot-server"
    ...
  },
```

## Options

You can use the following options.

```
Usage: react-snapshot-server [options] [command]

Commands:

  help  Display help

Options:

  -h, --help                   Output usage information
  -p, --port <n>               The port on which the server will be running (defaults to 3000)
  -s, --snapshot_duration <n>  Time in minutes that a snapshot is valid (defaults to 10)
  -v, --version                Output the version number
```

### Installing

Install React Snapshot Server by running `yarn add react-snapshot-server -D`

React Snapshot Server works *almost* out of the box with zero configuration if you use
[Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app) we do
require a few little changes, but it only takes a few seconds work!

Open up your `src/index.js` file.
and replace
```diff
- import ReactDOM from 'react-dom';
+ import { render } from 'react-snapshot-server';

- ReactDOM.render(<App />, document.getElementById('root'));
+ render(App, document.getElementById('root'));
```

and that's it, you now have server side rendering!
